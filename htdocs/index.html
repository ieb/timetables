			<h1>Lecture Listings</h1>
			<p>
				Information about lectures provided by Faculties for the academic year 2012-13 is provided here, either in the form of direct links to Faculty or departmental websites 
				or, for subjects participating in the pilot system, a calendar version which can be viewed either as a report or a weekly timetable.
			</p>
			<p>
				Information is accessed via the drop-down boxes, and is presented under the Faculty responsible for the course, with the exception of the Natural Sciences and Medical 
				and Veterinary Sciences Triposes which have their own listings.
			</p>
			<p>
				As with all new systems there are likely to be some initial problems.  If you encounter difficulties it may help to try using another browser.  If the problem persists 
				please contact timetables-support@caret.cam.ac.uk
			</p>
			<h2>Natural Sciences Tripos Part IA and Part IB</h2>
			<p>
				Please note that timetables include all possible practicals; for Part IA you will be allocated to particular slots according to your choice of subjects, for Part IB 
				you will arrange specific times during introductory sessions on 4th & 5th October.
